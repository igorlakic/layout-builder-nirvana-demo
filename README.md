# Layout Builder Nirvana Demo
Short demo of a fresh approach for Drupal's Layout Builder module

You can find an article about this on my website: https://mosaicwebsites.com/blog/layout-builder-nirvana

This repo is created so you can take a look at the code I added inside of the Olivero theme. Be warned that it's not advisable to customize Drupal core themes directly. In this case I did that just to show my Layout Builder approach.

Files you would be interested to take a look into are: 
- olivero.layouts.yml
- layout--simple-cards.html.twig
- olivero.layout_options.yml
- block--simple-card.html.twig
- block--title.html.twig

Configuration of this demo website is also commited here so you can give it a try (DDEV config already here also) and go through the example.
